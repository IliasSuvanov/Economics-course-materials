# Consumer theory

To answer questions about individual decision making, we need a model of individual behavior. Our model of consumer behavior is based on the following premises:
- Individual __tastes__ or __preferences__ determine the amount of pleasure people derive from the goods and services they consume.
- Consumers face constraints or limits on their choices.
- Consumers maximize their well-being or pleasure from consumption, subject to the constraints they face.

## Sturcture of consumer theory

1. Preferences. We use three properties of preferences to predict which combinations, or bundle, of goods an individual prefers to other combinations.
2. Utility. Economists summarize a consumer’s preferences using a utility function, which assigns a numerical value to each possible bundle of goods, reflecting the consumer’s relative ranking of these bundles.
3. Budget Constraint. Prices, income, and government restrictions limit a consumer’s ability to make purchases by determining the rate at which a consumer can trade one good for another.
4. Constrained Consumer Choice. Consumers maximize their pleasure from consuming various possible bundles of goods given their income, which limits the amount of goods they can purchase.
5. Behavioral Economics. Experiments indicate that people sometimes deviate from rational, maximizing behavior.

## Properties of Consumer Preferences

- Completeness
- Transitivity
- More Is Better

## Indiffernce curves

Proposition:
- Higher is better
- Downward sloping
- Never cross
- One indifference curve through any given bundle

## Utility Functions

Let's move from verbal representation of preference assumptions to mathematical representation.
We assume that any persons preferences generated by some mathematical function. For example your preferences for place of work is generated by $U(job market, nature) = \sqrt{JobMarket*Nature}$$ formula.


If we knew the utility function—the relationship between utility measures and every
possible bundle of goods—we could summarize the information in indifference maps
succinctly. Lisa’s utility function, U(Z, B), tells us how many utils she gets from Z
pizzas and B burritos. Given that her utility function reflects her preferences, if Lisa
prefers Bundle 1, (Z1, B1), to Bundle 2, (Z2, B2), then the utils she gets from the first
bundle are greater that from the second bundle: U(Z1, B1) 7 U(Z2, B2).
For example, suppose that the utility, U, that Lisa gets from burritos and
pizzas is
$$U(Z,B) = \sqrt{Z*B}$$.
From Equation, we know that the more she consumes of either good, the greater
the utility that Lisa receives. Using this function, we can determine whether she would
be happier if she had Bundle x, with 16 pizzas and 9 burritos, or Bundle y, with 13 of
each. The utility she gets from x is 12 (= 216 * 9) utils. The utility she gets from
y is 13 (= 213 * 13) utils. Therefore, she prefers y to x. The utility function is a
concept that economists use to help them think about consumer behavior; utility
functions do not exist in any fundamental sense.

## Marginal Utillity

## Slope and shape of indifference curves

The slope of indifference curve
is the rate at which you're willing to give up
one good to get another.



![MRS]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mrs1.png)

![MRS]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mrs2.png)

__Graphs are taken from Jonathan Gruber Microeconomics course__


**MRS = \frac{- \Delta P }{\Delat M} = \frac{-MU_{movies}}{MU{pizzas}}

The marginal rate of substitution is diminishing. And that's because of the diminishing marginal utility. Marginal utility diminishes,
because each additional movie is worth less to you
that the one before. Each additional pizza is worth less to you
than the one before.


## Budget constraint

Knowing an individual’s preferences is only the first step in analyzing that person’s
consumption behavior. Consumers maximize their well-being subject to constraints.
The most important constraint most of us face in deciding what to consume is our
personal budget constraint.

![Budget]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/budget_cons.png)



The slope of the budget line is called the __marginal rate of transformation (MRT)__:
the trade-off the market imposes on the consumer in terms of the amount of one good
the consumer must give up to purchase more of the other good:

$$MRT = \frac{-P_z}{P_B}$$


```note
Marginal rate
of substitution is the rate at which you desired to trade off pizza for movies staying indifferent. The marginal rate of transformation is the rate at which the market allows you
to trade off pizza for movies.
```
Marginal rate of substitution is about your tastes.
It's about the rate at which you desire
to trade one off for the other.
The marginal rate of transformation is about the market conditions.
It's the rate at which the market allows you to trade off
one for the other.

Opprotunity cost is the value of the next best forgone alternative.

## Changes to budget constaraints

## Constrained Choice



When we choose a point, we are thinking od marginal decisions. Whether we should have next pizza, or should we have next movie?

$$MRS =\frac{-MU_{A}}{MU_{B}}$$, is the amount of A that will be given up for obtaining each additional unit of B.

At the optimum bundle(point) the marginal rate of substitution
equal to the marginal rate of transformation. In other words the rate
at which you'd like to trade off pizza for movies should be equal
to the rate at which the market is allowing you to trade off
pizza for movies.

## Corner solution

We end up with optimal bundle that is combination of two goods, but in some cases  a consumer will end up just with one good.

### Food stamps

### Exercise

Nate’s utility function over jelly, J, and peanut butter, N, is U = JN. Nate’s marginal utility from jelly is MUJ = N, and his marginal utility from peanut butter is
MU
N = J.15 The price of a jar of jelly is $5. The price of a jar of peanut butter is
$10. Nate has a budget of $100 to allocate to these two items. If Nate maximizes
his utility, how much of each good does he consume?
Answer
1. Derive Nate’s budget line by setting his expenditure equal to his budget. The expenditure on each item is its price times the amount consumed, so Nate’s budget, 100, equals the sum of the expenditures on these two goods: 100 = 5J + 10N.
2. Use Equation 4.8 to find the relationship between N and J. Equation 4.8 states that Nate maximizes his utility if he equalizes his marginal utility per dollar across jelly and peanut butter: MUJ/5 = MUN/10. That is, N/5 = J/10 or N = J/2.
3. Substitute this utility-maximizing condition into the budget equation to determine J and N. Substituting this optimality condition into the budget constraint, we learn that 100 = 5J + 10N = 5J + 10(J/2) = 10J. Solving this expression for J, we find that J = 10.
4. Substitute the solution for J into the budget line to solve for N. Substituting J = 10 into the budget constraint, we learn that 100 = 5J + 10N = 50 + 10N, or 50 = 10N, or N = 5. Thus, Nate’s utility-maximizing bundle is ten jars of jelly, J = 10, and five jars of peanut butter, N = 5

## Demand Curve

### Deriving Demand Curve

### Shock of Income to Demand Curve

![engel curve]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/engel_curve.png)

Income elasticity of Dmenad $$\xi= \frac{\Delta Q/ Q}{\Delta Y/ Y}$$

Most goods, like cars and food, have positive income elasticities. A good is called
a **normal good** if as much or more of it is demanded as income rises. Thus, a good is
a **normal good** if its income elasticity is greater than or equal to zero: $$\xi \geq 0$$.


Some goods, however, have negative income elasticities: $$\xi < 0$$. A good is called
an **inferior good** if less of it is demanded as income rises. We are not making a value
judgment when we say a good is inferior. An inferior good need not be defective or
of low quality. Some of the better-known examples of inferior goods are foods such
as potatoes and cassava that very poor people typically eat in large quantities. Some
economists—apparently seriously—claim that human meat is an inferior good: Only
when the price of other foods is very high and people are starving will they turn to
cannibalism. Bezmen and Depken (2006) estimate that pirated goods are inferior: a
1% increase in per-capita income leads to a 0.25% reduction in piracy.\

Another strange example concerns treating children as a consumption good. Even
though people can’t buy children in a market, people can decide how many children
to have. Guinnane (2011) surveyed the literature and reported that most studies find
that the income elasticity for the number of children in a family is negative but close
to zero. Thus, the number of children demanded is not very sensitive to income.

**Luxuries** are the goods that have $$\xi >1 $$ and **necessities** are the goods that have $$\xi < 1$$.

### Fast food engel curve

### Income effects and Substitution effects

When the price goes up the demand for good goes down. It is happening from two differnt effects, namely income effect and substitution effect. \
    The **substitution effect** is, when a price goes up, how much less of that good
do you want, holding your utility constant.\
    The **income effect** is, how much less of the good do you want because you are having less money.

![substitution and income effect]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/inc_effect.png)


### Inferior good

If a good is inferior, the income effect and the substitution effect move in opposite
directions. For most inferior goods, the income effect is smaller than the substitution
effect. As a result, the total effect moves in the same direction as the substitution
effect, but the total effect is smaller. However, if the income effect more than offsets
the substitution effect, we have a **Giffen good**, for which a decrease in its price causes the quantity demanded to fall. \

Jensen and Miller (2008) showed that rice is a Giffen good in Hunan, China.
Ximing, a typical inhabitant of Hunan, views rice as a Giffen good. A fall in the rice
price saves him money that he spends on other goods. Indeed, he decides to increase
his spending on other goods even further by buying less rice. Thus, his demand curve
for this Giffen good has an upward slope. \

However, the Law of Demand (Chapter 2) says that demand curves slope downward. You’re no doubt wondering how I’m going to worm my way out of this apparent contradiction. The answer is that I said that we believe in the Law of Demand
because we do not observe upward sloping demand curves, not because our theory
says that it must be true. It is theoretically possible for a demand curve to slope
upward, but other than rice consumption in Hunan, China, economists have found
few real-world examples of Giffen goods.
