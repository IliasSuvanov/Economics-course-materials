# Shapes of Supply and Demand curve

We have looked at market equilibrium and shifts in quantity and price of goods that are sold under the market shock. We discussed only qualitative part of shifts. We have not disscussed the magnintude in the change of prices and quantities of goods sold.

```note
Shapes of supply and demand curve determine **how much** a price and quantity changes under the shock.
```

```note
Perfectly inelastic demand means the demand does not change under any circumstances.
```

There is no goods in real-life that are perfectly inelasic.


```note
Perfectly elastic demand is the demand for the good, when people are ready to pay a given price and no penny more. If the good will be one penny cheaper, buyers will buy infinite amount.
```





## Price elasticity of Demand

The price **elasticity of demand** (or in common use, the elasticity of demand) is the
percentage change in the quantity demanded, __Q__, in response to a given percentage
change in the price, __p__, at a particular point on the demand curve. The price elasticity
of demand (represented by $$\varepsilon$$, the Greek letter epsilon) is
$$\varepsilon = \frac{\text{percentage change in quantity demanded}}{\text{percentage change in price}} =
\frac{\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}}{\frac{\Delta P}{P}}$$

---

For example,
if a 1% increase in the price results in a 3% decrease in the quantity demanded, the
elasticity of demand is $$\varepsilon$$ = -3%/1% = -3.3 Thus, the elasticity of demand is a pure
number (it has no units of measure).

## Price elasticity of Supply

Just as we can use the **elasticity of demand** to summarize information about the shape
of a demand curve, we can use the elasticity of supply to summarize information
about the supply curve. The price elasticity of supply (or elasticity of supply) is the
percentage change in the quantity supplied in response to a given percentage change
in the price. The price elasticity of supply (represented by $$\eta$$, the Greek letter eta) is

## Problem

The estimated equation for the linear U.S. corn demand curve is $$Q = 15.6 - 0.5p$$,
where p is the price in dollars per bushel and Q is the quantity demanded in billion
bushels per year. What is the elasticity of demand at the point on the demand curve
where the price is $$p = 7.20$$ per bushel?

```note
The shape of the demand curve depends on the relevant period. Consequently, a
short-run elasticity may differ substantially from a long-run elasticity.
(Oil prices, frozen goods)

## Equilibrium effects on specific tax

```note
Tax incidence means who bears the burden of taxation.
```

```tip
Economic burden of the tax typically differs from who gets taxed, because market reacts to the tax.
```

Statuatory tax incidence $$\neq$$ Economic tax incidence. \
The price responses in the market
are going to work to counteract the statutory burdens of who
the tax is imposed on.\
Let' defince Consumer Tax Bruden as $$(p_{post}-p_{pre})+ \text{tax payment per unit}$$. \
Producer Tax Burden $$(p_{pre}-p_{post})+\text{tax payment per unit}$$


Whether the goverment will tax consumers or producers, it is irrelevant to economic tax incidence.

Question: Deputy A suggests taxing 1$ corn producers for every bushel they sell, deputy B suggests taxing 1$ corn consumers for every bushel they buy. Whom we should support?


## Economic incidence is determined by elasticities
