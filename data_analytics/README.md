# Data Analytics with Python


## Course Description

Course is lectured for AUCA students. The course is devoted to the practice of data analytics in the Python language. First of all, we will learn the basics of Python language in order to manage and analyze data. Then, we will learn the basics of data analytics, such as plotting graphs, pie charts, histograms. We will learn Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, SciPy and others. We will cover techniques in modern data analysis: estimation, regression and econometrics, prediction, experimental design, randomized control trials (and A/B testing), machine learning, and data visualization. We will illustrate these concepts with applications drawn from real world examples and frontier research. This course is oriented for social scientists.

Instructor: Ilias Suvanov

```note
There is no need to install Python to your local machine, you can directly use Python through [Google Colab Service](https://colab.research.google.com/)
